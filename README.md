# Banking-interface
A banking interface functionality created by following an udemy tutorial by Jonas Schmedtmann. The course can be found here: 
https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/

The HTML and CSS were provided by the files in the tutorial, and all functionality was coded in JavaScript. To log in, you must use one of the four existing accounts:
username/pw: js/1111, jd/2222, stw/3333, ss/4444

You will then be presented with transactions that took place on the existing account. All accounts and their respective information was stored in objects. It is possible to transfer money between the accounts, or to request a loan from the bank. It is also possible to delete the account, which will then delete the object and the account won't be accessible anymore until restarting the page. There is a simple logout timer which will simply render the main interface invisible after the timer reaches zero. The timer is reset to its original state everytime there is some interaction on the website.
